1. FarmConnect :– A Farmer–to-Market-supply-chain

2. Overview :-
   
FarmConnect – Java + MySQL Based A Farmer–to-Market-supply-chain
A role-based console application that connects farmers and buyers. Farmers can add and manage their products, while buyers can browse, place orders, and make payments (COD/Online). The system is built using Java (business logic) and MySQL (persistent storage), simulating a full-stack workflow with:

User interaction (console-based UI),
Backend processing (Java classes & DAO layer),
Database management (MySQL with ER schema).

Key Features:-

Farmer login to add/manage products.
Buyer login to view products, place orders, and track order history.
Payment system with COD/Online options.
Exception handling and DAO pattern for clean database operations.
System Architecture included for better understanding.

This project demonstrates hands-on experience with Java programming, database integration, and real-world system design principles, making it a strong foundation for full-stack development.

3. Features:-

Farmer module (register, add products, view orders).
Buyer module (browse products, place orders, make payments, view history).
Database integration with MySQL.
Console-based UI, ready to extend into a web app.

4. Tech Stack:-

Java (Core + JDBC)
MySQL
ER & System Architecture design

5. Database Setup:-

Run the SQL script (sql/farmconnect_schema.sql).

6. How to Run

Compile and run from src/.
Requires JDK 8+ and MySQL installed.

7. Future Enhancements

Convert to a Spring Boot + React full-stack app.
Add authentication.
Deploy on cloud (AWS/Heroku).
